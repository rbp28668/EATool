Provides a set of proxy classes to provide a facade for scripting.
<p>These classes typically wrap items in the repository and provide
more user-focussed operations than the underlying classes.  The top
level class is {@link Application} that is put into the context
of the scripting languages at <code>app</code>.
</p>
<p> Note that as the scripts are run in a seperate thread it is necessary
for methods of these objects to explicitly run in the main UI dispatch thread
using <code>java.awt.EventQueue.invokeAndWait(Runnable)</code>.
