# EATool
Enterprise Architecture tool

Initially created many years ago this is an Enterprise Architecture tool primarily.  
However, the flexible metamodel and ability to extend with scripting, import and export of data
does allow it to be applied to pretty much application where you need to record data about "things and their relationships"
